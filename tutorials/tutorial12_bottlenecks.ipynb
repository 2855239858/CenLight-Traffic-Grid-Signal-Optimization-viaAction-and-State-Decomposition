    "# Tutorial 12: Bottleneck Experiments 瓶颈实验\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of *running the bottleneck experiments*. The bottleneck experiment, depicted in Fig. 1, is intended to illustrate the dynamics of traffic in a bottleneck. In particular, our bottleneck is intended to imitate the dynamics of traffic on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, where fifteen lanes narrow to eight to five. In our bottleneck, we have N * 4 lanes narrow to N * 2 to N, where N is a scaling factor that can be used to increase the number of lanes. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, this bottleneck has a phenomenon known as *capacity drop*: as the number of vehicles flowing into the system increases the number of exiting vehicles initially increases. However, above a critical flow of entering vehicles, the output of the system starts to decrease as congestion forms. Just like in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, there is a configurable toll booth and a set of traffic lights that can be used to control the inflow. Each of the merges is implemented as a zipper merge, in which the vehicles merge as late as possible. \n",

    "本教程将指导您完成“运行瓶颈实验”的过程。图1所示的瓶颈实验旨在说明瓶颈中的流量动态。特别地，我们的瓶颈旨在模拟旧金山-奥克兰海湾大桥上的交通动态，那里有15条车道窄至8至5条。在我们的瓶颈中，我们有N * 4条窄至N * 2到N的车道，其中N是一个比例因子，可以用来增加车道的数量。如图2所示，这一瓶颈出现了*容量下降*的现象:随着进入系统的车辆数量的增加，最初退出系统的车辆数量也随之增加。然而，在进入车辆的临界流量之上，系统的输出开始以拥塞的形式减少。就像在旧金山-奥克兰海湾大桥，有一个可配置的收费站和一组红绿灯，可以用来控制流入。每一个合并都是作为一个zippers合并来实现的，在这个过程中，车辆合并的时间越晚越好。\n",
