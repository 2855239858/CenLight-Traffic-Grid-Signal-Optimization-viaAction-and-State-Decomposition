    "- (3) Every second, a vehicle should enter with probability 0.1 on the left lane of the on-merge, with random speed. These vehicles should only start entering the network after the first minute of simulation time, and there should be at most 30 of them throughout the whole simulation. These vehicles should be colored in red.\n",
